# The intent of {readme2pkg} is to let you build quick packages right from a readme. The function `readme2pkg::chunk_to_dir` (and friends) lets you send code chunk contents to a new file in your subdirectory.  This means you don't have to manage a bunch of files that constitute a package - at least in the early stages.  

Also, the [EvaMaeRey/readme2pkg.template](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/readme2pkg.template) repo on github template repository that meant to complement the readme2pkg workflow.  Using the readme.Rmd in the template, you can populate the sections with your material (introduction and functions, etc).  And the readme contains a checklist that will help you get through the steps of creating a package, including building the correct file architecture, licensing, documentation, and builds.  Most of this is accomplished through the {devtools} and {usethis} packages.  Code is included that lets you 'check-off' the items as you run the code. 

Imagine you write this function in a code chunk:

````verbatim

```{r add_one_code}
times_two <- function(x){
  
  x*2
  
}
```

````

With readme2pkg::chunk_to_dir we are able to create an 'R file with the name 'add_one_code.R' that contains the code from the chunk as follows. It will be saved in the R directory, which will make it part of the package.  



````verbatim

```{r, eval = F}
readme2pkg::chunk_to_dir("times_two", dir = "R")
```

````


## Background and motivation

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->


I would like to:

- have more fun while developing by doing so collaboratively! 
- work with non-package developer and have my decision to be informed by their expertise - possibly getting their feedback right in github?
- keep better track of where I am in the development process.

## Other's reflecting on how it might be difficult to find the 'narrative' from an R package

> 'finding ways to contribute to open source packages can be daunting um how do you like what what process do you have when you're first like looking at a new project that you might be involved in a new package ...' Colin

> ... where do you start? Because i know for damn sure you don't want to open the r directory and start reading the files in alphabetical order right which is in some sense kind of feels like the most natural thing to do because you're like pretty sure that the r folder is the business end of the package and then
because we're plagued by alphabetical ordering it sort of feels like maybe you should just start clicking on the files and reading them and i know that does not work very well um so at this point like when i for some reason like need to become involved in a

> ... you know you know books are meant to be read. Right, like there's a beginning a middle and an end or like you're told it's a reference book and and it's kind of clear how to go to a particular place. Packages are not meant to be read and so it is i think fundamentally kind of awkward ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LktoXh7WvY

# More great package building resources to be aware of 

- Jacob Bien & Patrick Vossler's [litr](https://jacobbien.github.io/litr-project/index.html) - similar motivation, but felt more like for use on a finished product? I guess I like the steps more unbundled than 'one function to rule them all'.

The goal of readme2pkg collects strategies for making the README.Rmd the main workplace and/or storytelling document. 

# How we make and use {readme2pkg}

# Part 0. Presteps

## A. created a github repository, e.g. https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/readme2pkg

## B. create a local directory ("coolest_pkg) via projects,  linking your repo.

You can do this from RStudio via New Project -> Version Control -> Git -> Repository URL (fill field with git repo URL from part A)

## C. create README.rmd in a directory via usethis::use_readme_rmd()

# Part 1. Develop functionality (in readme)

## pull in `return_chunk_code`, which is in a development package...

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```

```{r knitcodegetlive, code = readr::read_lines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EvaMaeRey/knitcodegetlive/main/R/flairliverework.R")}


```


Write useful code (might be rearrangement of verbose code).

`chunk_to_dir()` will create a file with the chunk name

## write `chunk_to_dir()`

```{r chunk_to_dir}
#' Title
#'
#' @param chunk_name
#' @param dir
#' @param extension
#' @param file_name
#'
#' @return
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
chunk_to_dir <- function(chunk_name, dir = "R/", extension = ".R"){

    for(i in 1:length(chunk_name)){

  # knitr::knit_code$get(name = chunk_name[i]) |>
  return_chunk_code(chunk_name = chunk_name[i]) |>  
    paste(collapse = "\n") |>
    writeLines(con = paste0(dir,"/",  chunk_name[i], extension))

    }
  
  }
```


```{r}
return_chunk_code("chunk_to_dir")


```

## write `chunk_to_r()` and `chunk_to_tests_testthat()` 


```{r convenience}
#' Title
#'
#' @param chunk_name
#'
#' @return
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
chunk_to_r <- function(chunk_name){

  chunk_to_dir(chunk_name = chunk_name)

}


#' Title
#'
#' @param chunk_name
#'
#' @return
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
chunk_to_tests_testthat <- function(chunk_name){

  chunk_to_dir(chunk_name = chunk_name, dir = "tests/testthat/")

}
```

You may notice that we've inserted a 'roxygen' skeleton as well. This is for the purpose of documenting the functions in a package.  
At this point, we haven't completed the work of describing parameters and filling in the title and adding an example, and describing what is returned.  However, including the skeleton is will allow the functions work in the package *as exported functions* (`#' @export`) and serve as a reminder that we have more work to do in terms of documentation. 





## Try it out

We're gonna send our code to the r folder... With the functions we just created. Knitr never stops ðŸ˜®! 

```{r}
chunk_to_r("knitcodegetlive")
chunk_to_r("chunk_to_dir")
chunk_to_r("convenience")
```


It would be good to turn this section into formal tests, but I'm not exactly sure what the best practice is for functions that create new files and self reference as knitr functions do. Would be good to get some technical expertise on that.  



# Efficiently writing convenience functions with templating and expansion


```{r print_hello}
#' Print specific character string
#'
#' @return a character string
#' @export 
#'
#' @examples
#' print_hello()
print_hello <- function(){
  
  "Hello"
  
}
```

## `chunk_template_write_variants()`

```{r chunk_template_write_variants}
#' Title

```


### Moving functions R folder... âœ…  

Then send code chunks to directories as desired. 

```{r}
## Done above
```



### Managed dependencies? âœ… 

Dependenancies must be declared in your package.  

This means you'll use the `::` notation, e.g. `package::function()`.  In your function.  


Additionally, you'll send package dependencies to your DESCRIPTION
file; which can be done automatically with use this:

```{r, eval = F}
usethis::use_package("knitr")
usethis::use_package("stringr")
usethis::use_pipe()
```

### Chosen a license? âœ… 


```{r, eval = F}
usethis::use_mit_license()
```



### Run `devtools::check()` and addressed errors? âœ… 


### Push to github

## Step ii: Listen and iterate ðŸš§ 

### Consulted with potential users ðŸš§ 
### Consulted with technical experts e.g. statasticians, software developers, etc.

## Step iii. Polish.  Have you...

### Settled on examples and put them in the roxygen skeleton? ðŸš§ 

### Written formal tests of functions? ðŸš§ 


### Sent tests in this readme to package via readme2pkg ðŸš§ 

That would look like this...

```
chunk_to_tests_testthat("test_geom_barlab_count")
```


### Have you worked added a description and author information in the DESCRIPTION file? ðŸš§ 

### Addressed *all* notes, warnings and errors. ðŸš§ 

## Promote (less detail here at this point - reflects the rawness of readme2pkg)

### Package website built? ðŸš§ 

### Package website deployed? ðŸš§ 

## Harden

### Submit to CRAN?  ðŸš§ 


# Reports, Environment

## Description file extract

```{r}

```

## Environment

Here I just want to print the packages and the versions

```{r}
all <- sessionInfo() |> print() |> capture.output()
all[11:17]


```

## `devtools::check()` report

```{r, error = T, results = print_reports_action}
# rm(list = c("geom_barlab_count", "geom_barlab_count_percent"))
devtools::check(pkg = ".")
```





# Install development package with `devtools::build()`

```{r, error = T, eval = build_package, results = print_reports_action}
devtools::build()
```



## Repo Directory and files report

Let's look at the repository contents. 

```{r}
fs::dir_tree(recurse = T)
```









<!-- # 2. test interactively -->

<!-- # 7. promote -->
